# TwoCents FrontEnd

## Description

An app for doing something with your recommendations, TwoCents was created to help users save recommendations they receive and learn more information about that place. Initially focusing on recommended locations, users can look up a recommended location to see its reviews, today's hours, its price point, and view its location on Google Maps. Relying on the Yelp Fusion API, the app allows users to then save these locations to their collection, organizing them by category.

## Learning Goals
- Ultimately, demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow
- Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
